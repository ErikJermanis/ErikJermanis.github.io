# Tutorials

I write these tutorials primarily as a learning method. Whenever I learn something interesting, or want to write something down so I don't forget, I make a tutorial out of it.

- [Using cURL for API requests](using-curl-for-api-requests.md)
- [Git workflow for contributing to open source projects](git-workflow-for-contributing-to-open-source-projects.md)
- [Solution for caret jumping in React inputs](solution-for-caret-jumping-in-react-inputs.md)
