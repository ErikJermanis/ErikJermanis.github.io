# About

## General info

My name is Erik Jermani≈°. I am a 23 year old software developer with over 4 years of professional experience.

I live in Croatia.

## How it all began

Back when I was in kindergarten, we had a computer with a few old-school games installed on it. I always loved spending time on it, not just for playing games, but also for exploring everything else (mostly just clicking arround random menus). When my kindergarten teacher told my parents about my passion for computers, they decided to buy me a laptop. It was a bulky _Asus_ laptop with _Windows XP_.

We had no internet access at home, but that didn't stop me from learning all about the computer and the software installed on it. I used to spend hours and hours playing [Hamsterball](https://www.hamsterball.io/) and perfecting my score. Other than playing _Hamsterball_, my favorite activity was creating fictional documents and presentations in [Microsoft Office 2003](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Office_2003) programs. I actually learned how to use those programs without modern _YouTube_ tutorials :sweat_smile:.

## First encounter with programming

In high school, a professor introduced me to [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language. I immediately fell in love with coding. My first program wasn't the famous _"Hello world!"_, but a program that takes two numbers as an input and outputs their sum.

After that first lesson, I took the book that we had, and started learning everything in advance by myself. Even before halfway through the school semester, I had gone through the entire book and learned everything that needed to be learned for that school year.
