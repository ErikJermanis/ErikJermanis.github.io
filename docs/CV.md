I am a web developer with over 4 years of experience. I've worked on both frontend and backend projects, but most of my time, I had a role of frontend developer. My work experience includes working in teams but also on solo projects. Through my career, I had an opportunity to work on several different jobs which strengthened my developer skills.

I have a bachelor's degree in Information Technology from University of Rijeka, but I like calling myself a self taught developer.
